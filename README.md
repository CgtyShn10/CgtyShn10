# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Cagatay Sahin**, a **Computer Engineering student** (3rd year).

I focus on developing software and learning new ways to solve problems through code. Currently, I am working on improving my skills in software architecture and full-stack development.

My main tech stack includes **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Java, Database and C++**. I enjoy experimenting with these tools to build functional projects.
